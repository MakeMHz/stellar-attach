# About
``Project Stellar - Attach.xbe``, commonly referred to as ``attach.xbe``, is a dedicated application designed for the
original Xbox. Its primary function is to mount virtual disc images, supporting both ISO and CSO formats.

# Acknoweldgement
The pioneering idea of mounting virtual disc images on the Xbox was first presented by ``rmenhal`` through the release of
``driveimageutils``.
Although Project Stellar is an entirely new implementation crafted from scratch, the interface for mounting disc images
has been retained. This decision not only ensures legacy compatibility but also symbolizes our commitment to contributing
back to the open-source community.
